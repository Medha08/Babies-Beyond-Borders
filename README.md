# ADOPTION

## Adoption Definition
Adoption is a legal process by which a child is placed with a married couple or a single female who agrees to raise the child as their own and assumes all responsibility for them.

## Requirements for a Valid Adoption
No adoption is valid unless:
1. The person adopting is lawfully capable of adopting.
2. The person giving in adoption is lawfully capable of giving in adoption.
3. The person adopted is lawfully capable of being taken in adoption.

## Who May Adopt a Child
The following individuals are eligible to adopt a child:
- An Indian
- Non-Resident Indian (NRI)
- Foreign citizen (single female (unmarried, widowed, or divorced) or a married couple)

## Eligibility Criteria for Prospective Adoptive Parents
Prospective adoptive parents should:
- Be physically, mentally, and emotionally stable
- Be financially capable
- Be motivated to adopt a child
- Not have any life-threatening medical conditions

Any prospective adoptive parent, regardless of marital status and whether or not they have biological children, can adopt. A single female is eligible to adopt a child of any gender. However, a single male is not eligible to adopt a girl child.

In the case of a couple, the consent of both spouses is required. The couple must have at least two years of stable marital relationship.

## Age Criteria for Prospective Adoptive Parents
The age of prospective adoptive parents as on the date of registration determines eligibility:
- **Up to 4 years old child:**
  - Maximum composite age of prospective adoptive parents: 90 years

  - Maximum composite age of prospective adoptive parents: 110 years
  - Maximum age of single prospective adoptive parent: 55 years

The minimum age difference between the child and either prospective adoptive parent should be at least twenty-five years. Couples with more than four children are not considered for adoption.

## Adoption Process
### Step 1: Registration
- Register with a recognized adoption coordinating agency.
- Avoid registering with multiple agencies.
- Most Central and State Governments have recognized adoption agencies.
- Prepare documentation, submit it to the agency, and complete registration.

### Step 2: Home Study and Counseling
- Conduct a home study at the couple's residence.
- Assess the couple's parenting abilities, motivations, preparations, strengths, and weaknesses regarding adoption.

### Step 3: Referral of the Child
- The agency will provide the medical file, Physical Examination Report, and other relevant information about the child.
- Once comfortable with the details, the agency will arrange for the couple to meet the child in person.
- The couple can spend time with the child to ensure compatibility.

### Step 4: Acceptance of the Child
- Once the couple identifies the child they wish to adopt, they can proceed to sign the necessary documents for acceptance.
